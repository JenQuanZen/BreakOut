Game: Breakout

Controls/keys:
Press enter to start game.
Make the paddle move left with the left arrow key
and move right with the right arrow key.
(Also, one more thing, see under 'Cheat').

Rules:
Move the paddle to bounce the ball off of 
the paddle, and use the ball to break the bricks.
If the ball goes off the bottom of the screen
(i.e. you fail to collide the paddle with the ball), you lose. 
You can make the ball have horizontal velocity by moving 
the paddle in the direction you want the ball to go when they collide.
To win, destroy all of the 3 rows of 5 blocks (15 blocks total).

Cheat:
If you press A you can fire bullets with
the paddle to destroy the blocks.
